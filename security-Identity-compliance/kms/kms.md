- AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed encryption service that enables you to create and control cryptographic keys for securing your
  data across AWS services and applications.
  - Create a Key: You can create and manage Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) using the AWS Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.
  - Encrypt and Decrypt Data: Use KMS to encrypt sensitive data, ensuring secure storage and transmission.
  - Integrate with AWS Services: AWS KMS works seamlessly with services like S3, RDS, Lambda, and Secrets Manager to provide automatic encryption.
  - Manage Key Policies: Set granular permissions for key usage using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
  - Audit and Monitor: AWS CloudTrail logs all key-related actions for security and compliance tracking.
